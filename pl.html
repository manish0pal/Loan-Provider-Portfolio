        Personal loans online are unsecured loans provided by the banks without taking any
        collateral security,
        though some PSU banks may insist on a guarantor. Personal loan can be taken for any personal
        requirement ranging from marriage to holidaying or maybe to buy a lifestyle product or
        medical
        emergencies. The end purpose is not important to the bank as long as it is not for
        speculative trading.
    </p>
    <p class="mrtop">
        Personal loan online is a simple hassle free process of acquiring personal finance with
        minimal
        documentation and within quick time. The bank will require the borrower’s documents
        regarding the
        proof of identity, residence along with income proof such as salary slip, bank statement and
        form 16 to
        initiate the process for loan sanction. </p>

    <p class="mrtop">
        After verifying the documents and checking the borrower’s credit score with Credit
        Information Bureau
        (India) Limited commonly known as CIBIL.com, the bank may decide whether to approve or
        reject the
        personal loans online.

    <h6>Personal Loan Interest Rates</h6>
</div>
<div class="left-text">
    <p class="mrtop">
        The personal loan interest rate is dependent on three major factors. First are borrower’s income
        and his
        ability to service the loan. Second is the company for which the borrower is working and third
        is the
        credit history of the borrower. The bank may reject the personal loan if the borrower has
        defaulted in
        his past dues on any credit card or loans.
    </p>
    <p class="mrtop">Once the borrower is qualified for the personal loan it takes close to about three
        days or so to get the
        loan amount disburse. The personal loan repayment is in equated monthly installments and tenure
        can
        vary from 1- 5 years.</p>
    <p class="mrtop">It is advisable for a borrower to get in touch with as many banks as possible and
        get them to make loan
        offers to him. Then he can then try to negotiate with them and select the most cost effective
        option for
        him. The borrower will also have to take into consideration the processing fee and prepayment
        charges

    <p class="mrtop">Always remember that personal loan in India should be taken in dire emergency as
        far as possible. Being
        classified as unsecured loans, these loans are usually more expensive in terms of interest rate
        compare
        to any other loan taken against collateral security like gold jewelry, high surrender value
        insurance
        policies, etc.</p>

    <h6>Personal Loan Eligibility</h6>
</div>
<div class="left-text">
    <p class="mrtop">Personal loans are provided by various Banks and NBFCs. There are various factors
        which affect your
        personal loan eligibility. Below mentioned are some of the few factors which the bank or the
        NBFC will
        consider while they decide on your loan eligibility.
    </p>

<div class="heading mrtop ltgrey">
    <h6>Financial Background </h6>
</div>
<div class="left-text">
    <p class="mrtop">
        This is the most important parameter that determines if you are eligible for a personal loan in
        India and
        also the quantum of loan you are eligible for. It will help the bank understand how well you can
        pay back
        your loan. Every bank will have a minimum level of income to be eligible for a loan.

    </p>

<div class="heading mrtop ltgrey">
    <h6>Personal Loan Credit History</h6>
</div>
<div class="left-text">
    <p class="mrtop">
        This will help the bank ascertain your track record for payment of EMI of any loan or the payment of the
        credit card bills. In case you have paid all your previous EMIs and credit card bills on time, chances of
        your getting the loan is higher.
    </p>
    <p class="mrtop">
        Company in which you are employed:
    </p>
    <p class="mrtop">
        Loan eligibility may depend upon the company you are working for. In case your company is a Public LTD
        or among the A Class Companies, which the banks call them as, the chances of you getting a loan
        becomes very easy. If you are working for a B class company, then getting a personal loan in India may
        be difficult for you or it may be costlier also compared to a person who is working in an A class company.
        Which means that if you are working for a company which belongs to the A class according to the bank,
        then the personal loan rate would be comparatively lower to a person who belongs to a B class
        company.
    </p>

        Any other loans you may be holding:
    </p>
    <p class="mrtop">
        In case you are having any other loan at the given point of time, then your eligibility for personal loan
        may go down. As you are already paying towards EMI of the previous loan and the income in your hand
        would be lower compared to a case where you are not paying any EMI.
