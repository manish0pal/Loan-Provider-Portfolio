        Home loan or housing loan is a secured loan product where the lender provides funding for purchase or
        construction of a house/ residential property.
    </p>
    <p class="mrtop">
        A home loan can be availed either for buying a new house or resale of residential house.
    </p>
    <p class="mrtop">
        One can also avail a home loan product for the purpose of buying a plot of land and carrying out
        construction on the same, which is called composite loan.
    </p>
    <p class="mrtop">
        Home loans are provided by the financial institutions up to maximum of 80% (90% for loan amount
        below Rs 20 lakhs) of the agreement value of the house.
    </p>
    <p class="mrtop">
        In case of house loan for resale flats, most lenders get the property valued independently and they will
        provide the home loan based on their value rather than the cost mentioned in the purchase agreement.
    </p>
    <p class="mrtop">
        Frequently, the valuation as determined by the banker’s valuer for the purpose of home loan is
        significantly lower than the actual cost and hence the requirement of the borrowers for down payment
        for the loan goes up.

    </p>
    <p class="mrtop">
        Also note that banks do not consider other charges like Stamp Duty, Registration Charges, etc. while
        considering the home loan amount eligibility.
    </p>
    <p class="mrtop">
        Home loans are repaid through monthly installments (EMI) spread over up to 20 years. Some of the
        banks provide housing loan in India even for a tenure extending up to 25 – 30 years.
    </p>
    <p class="mrtop">
        The maximum tenure of any loan and house loan specifically is also restricted by the borrower’s age at
        the end of the tenure so as to ensure that the loan gets fully paid by or before the retirement age.
    </p>
    <p class="mrtop">
        A home loan can primarily be classified into two categories on the basis of interest rates i.e. fixed rate
        and floating rate of interest.

    </p>
    <p class="mrtop">
        There are very few lenders in India who offer pure fixed rates where the rate of interest remains
        constant for the entire tenure of the house loan, while most lenders have a reset clause of 3-5 years.
    </p>
    <p class="mrtop">
        In floating home loan type, the rate of interest on such loans is subject to change whenever there are
        changes in the repo rates announced by RBI or any changes in base rate of the bank.
    </p>
    <p class="mrtop">
        Borrower should opt for fixed interest rates only if she/he is certain that the rate of interest is the
        lowest in the interest cycle.
    </p>
    <p class="mrtop">
        The home loans in India are provided by banks and housing companies. The popular ones being SBI,
        HDFC, ICICI, etc. In turn RBI and National Housing Bank regulate these respectively, which issues
        guidelines governing home loans in India from time to time.
    </p>
    <p class="mrtop">
        In recent times, some lenders have come up with innovative house loan products like dual rate of
        interest where the interest rate on such loans remains fixed for initial 1-5 years and thereafter it
        automatically moves to a normal floating rate of interest.
    </p>
    <p class="mrtop">
        Here one should be aware that loan taken under dual rate, which starts as a fixed type of interest in the
        initial stages are treated as fixed rate home loan for the purpose of levy of penalty for prepayment of
        loans.
    </p>
    <p class="mrtop">
        In case where you prepay your housing loan the lender cannot levy any penalty for prepayment of such
        loan where the loan is taken under floating rate of interest as per the guidelines issued by RBI and
        National Housing Bank (NHB).

        Home Loan New customers
    </p>
    <p class="mrtop">
        In case you have been planning to buy your dream home for very long and you are unable to do that
        because of the rising prices everywhere, here is some help for you.

    </p>
    <p class="mrtop">
        You can take a home loan that will help you to buy your dream home. All you have to do is to save
        enough money to make the down payment of your home that is 20% of the property value.
    </p>

    <p class="mrtop">
        The remaining 80% of the amount can be taken as a loan from a bank depending upon how much loan
        you are eligible for.
    </p>

    <p class="mrtop">
        The bank will decide your home loan eligibility depending upon your income and various other
        parameters.
    </p>

    <p class="mrtop">
        These home loans can be repaid to the bank every month as equated monthly installments or more
        popularly known as EMI over the entire tenure of the loan.
    </p>
    <p class="mrtop">
        A part of this EMI goes towards repaying the principal component of the housing loan in India and the
        other part goes towards paying the interest. The EMI is calculated on a reducing balance basis.

    </p>
    <p class="mrtop">
        A reducing balance home loan means that in the initial days of the loan, the interest component of the
        EMI is high as the loan amount is high.

    </p>
    <p class="mrtop">
        But gradually, when the principal amount starts becoming lesser and lesser as you keep on paying it
        through EMI, the interest component of the EMI goes down and the principal component increases.
    </p>
    <p class="mrtop">
        Also, while you are going to take a home loan you need to decide, the type of interest rate you want to
        pay to the bank.
    </p>
    <p class="mrtop">
        The banks will offer you with an option of a fixed rate or a floating rate.

    </p>
    <p class="mrtop">
        Home loans with fixed interest rate mean that the interest rate is fixed for the entire tenure of the loan.

    </p>
    <p class="mrtop">
        But these days, most of these fixed interest rates come with a reset clause where the bank has an option
        to change the interest rate after a fixed period of time generally in a range of 3 to 5 years.

    </p>
    <p class="mrtop">
        There are also a few banks that give you a fixed interest rate for the entire term of the loan.
    </p>
    <p class="mrtop">
        The other type of housing loans is with floating interest rate where, the rates will depend on the base
        rate of the bank.

    </p>
    <p class="mrtop">
        As and when the bank will change their base rate, the interest rate will change for the customers.
        The change can either be in terms of EMI or tenure.
    </p>
    <p class="mrtop">
        For example, if the bank increases their base rate, the EMI will increase if the customer chooses the
        option to increase the EMI.
    </p>
    <p class="mrtop">
        Or in case the bank decides to decrease their base rate then the EMI will reduce for the customer.
        Generally the floating interest rates are cheaper compared to the fixed rates.
    </p>
    <p class="mrtop">
        Looking at the home loan interest rate scenario, this is quite an appropriate time to buy the home you
        were always looking to buy.
    </p>
    <p class="mrtop">
        The interest rates are on a rising trend thus in case you can manage to get a house loan right now, you
        can expect to get a better interest compared to what you will get a few months down the line.

    <h6>Home Loan Existing customer</h6>
</div>
<div class="left-text">
    <p class="mrtop">
        in case you have already bought a property and you are paying a very high house loan interest rate, then
        you should consider shifting your existing loan from existing home loan lender to a new home loan
        lender.


    </p>
    <p class="mrtop">
        This will decrease the monthly EMI you are paying towards your loan and will save money for you.
        You should consider shifting from the old BPLR system where the interest rate changes according to
        BPLR to the new base rate system.
    </p>
    <p class="mrtop">
        The base rate system is more transparent than the BPLR system. Thus the effort you put behind
        converting your old home from the BPLR to the base rate system will be worth devoting.

    </p>
    <p class="mrtop">
        Also you should act now as the home loan interest rates are increasing and you may miss the bus in case
        you wait for any longer.

    <h6>Home Loan Eligibility</h6>
</div>
<div class="left-text">
    <p class="mrtop">
        Home loan eligibility depends up on various factors. A few of them are listed below –

    </p>
    <p class="mrtop">
        <a href="#">Income</a> – Your income determines the amount of home loan you are eligible for. Banks generally keep
        the EMI to income ratio at 0.45 to 0.50.
    </p>
   
    <p class="mrtop">
        <a href="#">Tenure of the loan </a> 
        – The longer tenure you opt for, the more is your home loan eligibility.

Existing loans – In case you have any existing loans, then the loan eligibility amount will come down to
keep the EMI to income ratio around 0.50.
    </p>
    <p class="mrtop">
        <a href="#"> Interest rate offered </a> 
        – If your interest rates are on a lower side, then the loan eligibility will be higher
and vice versa.

Existing loans – In case you have any existing loans, then the loan eligibility amount will come down to
keep the EMI to income ratio around 0.50.
    </p>
    <p class="mrtop">
        <a href="#"> Existing loans </a> 
        – In case you have any existing loans, then the loan eligibility amount will come down to
keep the EMI to income ratio around 0.50.
    </p>
    <p class="mrtop">
        The lender will consider all these factors along with your credit history to determine how much housing
        loan you will be eligible for.
